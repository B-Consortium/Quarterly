The B-Consortium Quarterly was introduced in the consortium accords, on `18 June, 2024` as the first openly accessible communication. The site was introduced in an influence to predecessors [AitSad](https://github.com/AitSad), the only surviving material hence forth. Quarterly is introduced to archive research or activities produced by the the consortium. 

Under SR #1, it is stated:
```
The consortium will implement libraries, CLI's, and interfaces,
but the consortium in this research activity will take no aid
of any graphical interfaces, whatever the necessity is.
```

This is defined by consortium not as a graphical interface but markup hence compatible to standard rules set forth.
